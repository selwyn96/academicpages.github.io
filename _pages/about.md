I am currently a Research Assistant in the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by Prof. [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/). Previously, I completed my bachelor thesis at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) where I was advised by Prof.[Jonathan Manton](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/jmanton/). I was also fortunate to work part-time as a Research Consultant at [WorldQuant, LLC](https://www.worldquant.com/home/).

I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronics and Instrumentation from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), Goa, India in 2019. For detailed information check my [[CV](https://selwyn96.github.io/files/Selwyn_CV.pdf)] or shoot me an email.


## Research Interests

I am generally interested in the broad area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning. Recently, I have been exploring a number of diverse research areas and have been particularly interested in the following

* Generative modeling 
* Machine Learning algorithms for graph structured data.
* Bayesian optimization and multi-armed bandits.

# Recent News
* June 1, 2020. The paper titled "Sample Complexity Bounds for 1-bit Compressive Sensing and Binary Stable Embeddings with Generative Priors" was accepted to [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc/).
